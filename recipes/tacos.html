    <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Steak: In a bowl, combine the lime juice, orange juice, minced garlic, chopped cilantro, ground cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Place the steak in a large resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the steak, ensuring it's well-coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or ideally, marinate overnight for maximum flavor.</li>
        <li>Grill or Cook the Steak: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade and discard the marinade. Grill the steak for about 4-6 minutes per side (for medium-rare) or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the steak. Remove the steak from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain.</li>
        <li>Warm the Tortillas: Heat the tortillas on the grill or in a dry skillet for a few seconds on each side until warm and pliable.</li>
        <li> Assemble the Tacos: Place slices of the grilled steak onto each warm tortilla. Top with sliced red onions and chopped cilantro. Drizzle with salsa verde or your preferred salsa. Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the tacos.</li>
        <li>Serve Immediately: Serve your delicious Tacos de Carne Asada immediately while the steak is still hot.</li>
