    <img src="carbonara.jpg" alt="carbonara photo">
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish featuring spaghetti, eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta or guanciale, and black pepper. It's known for its creamy, flavorful sauce and simple preparation.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces (340g) spaghetti or any pasta of your choice</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan)</li>
        <li>3.5 ounces (100g) pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt (for pasta cooking water)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce: In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pancetta/Guanciale: In a large skillet over medium heat, add the diced pancetta or guanciale. Cook until it becomes crispy and renders its fat, about 5-7 minutes. If desired, add minced garlic and saut√© briefly until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce: Add the cooked and drained pasta to the skillet with the pancetta or guanciale. Toss to combine, allowing the pasta to absorb some of the flavorful fat from the pork.</li>
        <li>Add the Egg Mixture: Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss vigorously to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce seems too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta cooking water gradually until you achieve your desired creaminess.</li>
        <li>Serve Immediately: Carbonara is best served right away, while it's still creamy and hot. Garnish with extra Pecorino Romano cheese and black pepper if desired.</li>
    </ol>
