    <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the Noodles: In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce: In a large skillet, cook the ground meat over medium-high heat until it's browned and crumbled. Drain any excess fat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until they are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture: In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, and some salt and pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: In a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place three cooked lasagna noodles on top. Add half of the ricotta cheese mixture, spreading it evenly over the noodles. Sprinkle with a portion of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, until the lasagna is hot and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Final Browning: Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese on top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Rest and Serve: Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps it hold together better.</li>
